# Treklee Java Checkstyle

Checkstyle standards for Java code based on the [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Checkstyle version

The latest Checkstyle release version can be found [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/releases). The Google Java Style guide typically falls slightly behind the current release, so it's important to test before upgrading. Additionally, to ensure we're compliant with [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) tooling, this release should not be higher than their [plugin's version](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate-checkstyle/blob/master/CHECKSTYLE_VERSION).
